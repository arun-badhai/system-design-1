# SQL and NoSQL

SQL databases have pre-defined schemas, and NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas.

## SQL

SQL databases store things in rows and columns.
Each row contains all of the information about a single entity.

Examples of SQL databases are MySQL, SQLite, Postgresql, MariaDB, Oracle, and MS SQL Server.

## NoSQL

### Key-Value Stores

These NoSQL databases do exactly what it seems like they'd do: they map a given key, which is an attribute, to a value.

Examples of key-value stores are Redis, Voldemort, and Dynamo.
