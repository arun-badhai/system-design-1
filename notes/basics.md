# Basics

## Introduction

System design questions are typically used to evaluate the following of the interviewee:

* Experience with system design
* Thought process
* Ability to integrate new constraints
* Ability to maneuver a conversation

The questions are almost always intentionally vague.
When you're asked a system design question, be sure to spend at least a few minutes asking questions to clarify the constraints of the prompt.

To best solve system design problems:

* Learn from existing systems
* Lead the conversation
* Take a top-down approach
* When the interviewer wants to move in a certain direction, leave all else behind

## Questions to Ask

* What are the architectural pieces that can be used?
* How do these pieces work together?
* How can we best utilize the pieces, and what are the best tradeoffs to make?
